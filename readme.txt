This is data from a frog swimming kick. The length of the video event is 1 second over a duration of 62 frames (62 Hz frame rate).  The text file is time-varying hip joint angle data measured from the above video file, but sampled at 125 Hz.  The two data streams are therefore synced, but they have different sample rates.

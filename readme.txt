This is data from a frog swimming kick. The length of the video event is 1 second over a duration of 62 frames (62 Hz frame rate).  The text file is time-varying hip joint angle data measured from the above video file, but sampled at 125 Hz.  The two data streams are therefore synced, but they have different sample rates.  For reference, there is mathematica code in PDF format.
